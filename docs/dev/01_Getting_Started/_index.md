## What is this Guide about?

The main goal of this Guide is to give minimal required information to every new Pimcore developer.
In Pimcore platform there area a number of areas which you have to know before you start creating projects. 
If you would like to start fast, this is the most efficient way. 

You start with step by step [installation and configuration](!Getting_Started/Installation) process. 
Next, you determine about Pimcore architecture (directories structure, which area is editable ...).
Finally, you'll discover Documents, Objects, Assets and learn something about extensions development.
