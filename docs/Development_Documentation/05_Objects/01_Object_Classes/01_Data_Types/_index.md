All data types are wrapped in an object derived from ```Pimcore\Model\Object\Class\Data```. 
These data type objects provide getters and setters and they define the input widget in the frontend. 
Data type objects are displayed in the first column of the table above. 
The second column indicates the underlying data type class and the third column outlines the input widget used in pimcore 
to fill in, edit and display data objects.

See subpages of this page for detail documentation of different data types.
