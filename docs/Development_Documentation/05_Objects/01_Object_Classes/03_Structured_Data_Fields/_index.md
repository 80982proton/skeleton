List of all available structured data fields in Pimcore:

| Data tape                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Key Value](./01_Key_Value_Pairs.md)                 | It allows you to add an arbitrary number of key/value pairs to your object with the restriction that each key can only be added once to that object.                                    |
| [Fieldcollections](./03_Fieldcollections.md)         | Object field collections are predefined sets of data and layout fields, that can be added to objects at an arbitrary amount.                                                            |
| [Object Bricks](./04_Object_Bricks.md)               | With Objectbricks, objects can be extended without changing the class definition.                                                                                                       |
| [Table](./06_Table.md)                               | The table widget can hold structured data in the form of an array.                                                                                                                      |
| [Classification store](./08_Classification_Store.md) | The classification store has quite some similarities with the KeyValue datatype, the way how the keys can be added to the object differs as well as the variety of supported datatypes. |
| [Structures table](./09_Structured_Table.md)         | Similar to the table widget, the structured table can hold structured data but with predefined scheme.                                                                                  |
| [Block](./16_Blocks.md)                              | The block data type acts as a simple container for other data fields.                                                                                                                   |
